# Todo App




To use this Todo App, click the Edit/Add button to open a modal and enter the task details, including the title, task name, and optional image. Existing tasks can be edited by clicking the pencil icon or deleted using the trash icon. The app is built using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for a clean and modern interface. I did not use Material UI, as I am not yet familiar with it.
