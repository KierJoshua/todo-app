# Todo App




This Todo App allows users to manage tasks efficiently through a simple and intuitive interface. To add a new task, click the Edit/Add button, which opens a modal for entering task details. If tasks already exist, the button dynamically switches between Edit (to modify an existing task) and Add (to create a new task). Each task displays an image aligned to the side, along with a pencil icon for editing and a trash icon for deletion. The app is styled using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI, providing a clean, modern, and professional appearance while maintaining ease of use.
